# Service Restrictions

This kit module restricts resource types that can be created within a management group.
The restriction is implemented as a blacklist.

See [Resource providers for Azure services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-services-resource-providers) for a list of resource providers.

To find out which resource types are available for a provider, follow [View resource provider](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types?source=recommendations#view-resource-provider).
