# IONOS Virtual Data Center Building Block

Module that creates a Virtual Data Center in IONOS Cloud and assigns users in meshStack with Project permissions
in the newly created Virtual Data Center.
You can use it as a self-built platform integration in meshStack.

## How to create this Platform Integration in meshStack

1. Go to your meshStack Admin Area and click on "Platforms > Platforms" from the left pane
2. Click on "Create Platform"
3. For Platform Type, click the dropdown and hit "Create new Platform Type"
4. In this modal, enter a fitting name and identifier for your new IONOS platform
   - For an icon, you can use the file under `./icon.png`.
5. Continue the Platform Creation process.
6. Next, you will have to create a Building Block that will connect the Terraform and the newly created Platform.
7. On the left-hand side go to "Marketplace > Building Blocks" and click "Definitions".
8. Click "Create new Definition" and fill in some general information like name and description.
9. On the next page, set the following:
   - Supported Platforms -> Pick the Platform Type you created in Step 3.
   - How often assigned -> Once
   - Implementation Type -> Terraform
   - Terraform Version -> 1.5
   - Git Repository URL -> This repository, or, if you fork the code, your own repository
   - Git Repository Path -> `other-providers/ionos/virtual-data-center`
   - Enter a SSH Key if you are running from a private repository.
   - Enter a known host (if you are running from a self-hosted Git provider)
   - Deletion Mode -> pick "Delete Resources" if you want a `tf destroy` to run upon deletion in meshStack.
10. Go to the next page and skip the Dependency selection
11. For the Inputs, create the following Inputs:
    - `IONOS_TOKEN` (if you don't use an API token but username & password instead,
      you can do so as well with `IONOS_USERNAME` and `IONOS_PASSWORD`)
      - Set Source -> Static
      - Provide as -> Environment Variable
      - Set the variable to encryped
      - Enter your IONOS API Token as a value
    - Generate the necessary Terraform variables.
      To do so, at the top right click "Generate Inputs > Load Inputs" and paste in the content
      from `./variables.tf`
      - Set the `workspace_id` Source -> Workspace Identifier
      - Set the `project_id` Source -> Project Identifier
      - Set the `users` Source -> User Permissions
    - Backend configuration:
       - Select "File" as input type and upload the backend.tf file.
       - Add related environment variables based on your backend configuration (e.g. client_id and client_secret for azure, SA_ID and SA_EMAIL for GCS)
12. Go to the next page, which is Outputs, and create the following output:
    - `tenant_id`
      - Set the Assignment Type -> Platform Tenant ID
13. Create the new Building Block Definition
14. As a last step, we have to hook the new Building Block definition into a new landing zone so it will be rolled out on tenant creation.
15. On the left-hand side navigate to "Platforms > Platforms" and open your newly created IONOS platform.
16. Go to the Landing Zones tab and click "Create new Landing Zone"
17. Enter a fitting name, description and tags.
18. Under "Building Blocks" pick your newly created Building Block Definition and set it to "Mandatory".
19. Click Save
20. âœ… Your platform integration is successfully set up and workspaces can now freely book new tenants (Virtual Data Centers)
    for your platform.
