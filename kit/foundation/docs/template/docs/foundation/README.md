# Welcome to Cloud Foundation

## Your way to the cloud

Cloud adoption has two phases:
- The planning phase often begins with our consulting hours: Here you can inform yourself and ask your questions. In this phase you will choose a cloud provider and landing zone. Please note that not every service is available from every provider and landing zone. We recommend to create a solution design at this stage. Our cloud solution architects will support you in this.
- The implementation phase begins when you have access to your cloud tenant. Now it's time for the big move - migrate your application and if necessary your data!

## Cloud Providers

> ðŸš§ Adapt the list of cloud providers you want to offer.

Our strategic cloud partners are
- AWS
- Google
- Microsoft

We offer [landing zones](concepts.md#landing-zone) for each of those [platforms](/platforms/).

## Shared Responsibility Model

For our cloud offering, we rely on sharing responsibilities across three parties: cloud provider, cloud foundation team, and you (the application team).
Itâ€™s critical to understand which security tasks are handled by whom.

## Common responsibilities across all landing zones

The following responsiblities are with the cloud provider for all landing zones:
- Physical hosts
- Physical network
- Physical datacenter

The following responsibilities are with the cloud foundation team for all landing zones:
- Identities, SSO on cloud platform
- Audit Logs for calls against cloud platform APIs

The following responsibilities are with the applicaiton team for all landing zones:
- Permissions on the cloud platform

## Landing Zones and Responsibilities
