# Landing Zone Accelerator

## Background

Collie and Collie Hub, with all of its available kit modules, are open-source and fully usable for free.
Anyone can use Collie and Collie Hub to build and manage their cloud foundation and their landing zones.

Collie and Collie Hub are offered by [meshcloud](https://meshcloud.io/en/), which is a technology startup
that helps large organizations use the cloud effectively and efficiently.

To get organizations up-to-speed even quicker, meshcloud offers the
[Azure Landing Zone Accelerator](https://www.meshcloud.io/en/services/landing-zone-accelerator/) as a service to get
an up-and-running Azure Cloud Foundation Architecture within 6 weeks.

## The Azure Landing Zone Accelerator

The Azure Landing Zone Accelerator is **the** way to get your organization to Azure, fast and efficiently.
By doing a number of hands-on workshops with the cloud experts from meshcloud, and the powerful
Collie & Collie Hub technology, organizations can get their Azure Cloud Foundation built incredibly fast.

### Why the Azure Landing Zone Accelerator?

- **Based on open-source IaC tools**: The entire Accelerator uses open-source technology like
  Collie, and industry-leading IaC tool Terraform, which works across all cloud platforms.
- **Based on Microsoft best practices**: The Accelerator is inspired by
  [Azure Enterprise Scale](https://github.com/Azure/Enterprise-Scale), which a set
  of best practices for building a Cloud Foundation, coming directly from Microsoft.
- **Community-backed**: The Accelerator is backed by the Cloud Foundation Community,
  which regularly contributes new modules.
- **No PowerPoint**: Instead of using PowerPoint slide decks, the Accelerator delivers tangible results
  in the form of usable Infrastructure-as-Code and markdown-based documentation.

### What does it entail?

In the six weeks, we will work together on setting up all the key Essential (stage 1) capabilities
in the [Cloud Foundation Maturity Model](https://cloudfoundation.org/maturity-model/),
which allows you to start using the Azure cloud effectively within your organization.

These capabilities include:

- Document the shared responsibility model of your organization.
- Establish a resource hierarchy in Azure.
- Implement service and location restrictions in Azure.
- Enforce centralized audit logging in Azure.
- Align identity and access management.
- Understand basic cost management in Azure.

By design, Collie helps you build modular landing zones, which means it
is very easy to extend your landing zone with further capabilities in the future.

### Add-on packages

Beyond the key Essential capabilities for your Azure Cloud Foundation, there are two add-on packages for those cloud foundation
teams that need it:

**Infrastructure-as-Code Bootcamp**: Don't have Terraform or IaC experience? No problem!
In a short bootcamp we will get you all the basics of Terraform & Terragrunt.
This equips you with the right tools for working on your Azure Cloud Foundation.

**Networking Connectivity**: Providing a good networking setup is important in the cloud world. With this add-on, we will
work on getting a fitting networking setup for your organization & cloud. This can be a cloud-only network but also an
on-premise connectivity to your data center.
