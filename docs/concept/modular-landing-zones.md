# Modular Landing Zones

Modular landing zones allow a platform team to assemble landing zones from different modules.
This approach enables platform teams to provide landing zones tailored to specific categories of uses cases, rather than providing a "one-size fits all" landing zone.

You can learn more about this approach in the Cloud Foundation Maturity Model building block [Modular Landing Zones](https://cloudfoundation.meshcloud.io/maturity-model/tenant-management/modular-landing-zones.html).
