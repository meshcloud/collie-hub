# Landing Zone Concepts

This section explains various fundamental concepts of building landing zones with this construction kit.
The material is meant to provide context and insight into the opinions shaping its core workflows. If you're looking to understand ***why*** the kit is built a certain way, this section is for you. If you're look to solve a particular problem and want to understand ***how*** to achieve this, our [Guides](../guide/README.md) or [Tutorials](../tutorial/README.md) may be more useful to you.

We expect the information in this is useful to cloud foundation teams that have already a good familiarity with building landing zones in general and want to significantly extend their own construction kit. Since the kit meant to be very flexible apart from a few core worfklows, you may be able to significantly extend or alter some of the concepts we provide out of the box.
