summary: >-
  Teams can get managed access to central data warehouses and data lakes to
  combine this data with processing and infrastructure in their own cloud
  tenants. Common usage scenarios are "analyst workbenches" for cloud-native
  DL/DW tools like BigQuery that provide a self-service UI and "advanced data
  pipelines" where teams need to load/query data from the central lake into
  their own pipelines (e.g. different teams building ML models for different
  purposes from common data).

# Managed Data Lake access

Teams can get managed access to central data warehouses and data lakes to combine this data with processing and infrastructure in their own cloud tenants. Common usage scenarios are "analyst workbenches" for cloud-native DL/DW tools like BigQuery that provide a self-service UI and "advanced data pipelines" where teams need to load/query data from the central lake into their own pipelines (e.g. different teams building ML models for different purposes from common data).
