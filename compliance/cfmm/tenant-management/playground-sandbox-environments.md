# Playground / Sandbox Environments

Application teams can quickly provision cloud environments for experimentation and learning. Playgrounds use relaxed policies (e.g. more cloud services are allowed) but come with time- or spend-limits that are tightly controlled. Expired playgrounds are automatically deprovisioned.
