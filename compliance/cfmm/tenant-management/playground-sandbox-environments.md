# Playground / Sandbox Environments

DevOps Teams can quickly provision cloud environments for experimentation and learning, thereby accelerating an organization's cloud journey. Playgrounds use relaxed policies (e.g. more cloud services are allowed) but come with time- or spend-limits that are tightly controlled. Expired playgrounds are automatically deprovisioned.
